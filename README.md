# Share Code Anytime


## 🤷‍️ Why I Need It

- Do you want to share code with other people, however, you can only take screenshots or copy code to an app that dosen't support monospaced fonts?
- Do you want to find the corresponding code in the remote repository, but you have to search the branch and file in the codebase?
- Do you always find the remote repository of the dependencies from the `package.json` file in the `node_modules`

## 🎉 Features
